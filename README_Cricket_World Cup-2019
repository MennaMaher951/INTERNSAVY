## Cricket World Cup Data Analysis Project

Internship: Intern Data Scientist, INTERNSAVY

*Description:*

This project analyzes historical Cricket World Cup data to uncover insights and trends. It explores various aspects of the tournament, including:

Team performance and ranking over time
Player statistics and impact on matches
Match analysis and factors influencing outcomes
Prediction of future results using data-driven methods
Data:

The project utilizes publicly available datasets from sources like ESPN Cricinfo and Kaggle. These datasets cover various aspects of the Cricket World Cup, including match details, player statistics, and team information.

Methods:

Data cleaning and preprocessing: Data is cleaned for inconsistencies and missing values before analysis.
Exploratory data analysis: Data is visualized and analyzed to understand its characteristics and relationships between variables.
Statistical analysis: Hypothesis testing and correlation analysis are used to identify significant trends and relationships.
Machine learning: Models are trained to predict match outcomes based on historical data.
Results:

The project provides insights into team strengths and weaknesses over time.
Player performance analysis highlights impactful individuals and their contribution to team success.
Match analysis reveals key factors influencing match outcomes, such as batting performance, bowling economy, and toss advantage.
Prediction models achieve a certain accuracy in predicting match winners, demonstrating the potential of data-driven approaches in cricket analysis.
Technologies:

Programming languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning frameworks: (if applicable, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
Instructions:

Download the project files.
Install the required libraries (listed in requirements.txt).
