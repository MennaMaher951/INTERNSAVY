Graduate_Admission_2

This project explores graduate admission prediction using machine learning techniques. It analyzes a dataset of historical admissions data to:

Identify factors influencing admission chances
Build a model to predict future admissions

Dataset:

The project utilizes the "Admission_Predict.csv" dataset. This dataset contains information about various applicants, including:

GRE Score
TOEFL Score
University Rating
Statement of Purpose (SOP) score
Letter of Recommendation (LOR) score
CGPA
Research experience
Admission decision (admitted or not admitted)

Preprocessing:

Data cleaning: Missing values are handled, and irrelevant columns are removed.
Data transformation: Categorical variables are encoded, and numerical data is standardized.
Feature engineering: No additional features were created in this project.

Model Training:

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained to predict admission based on the applicant's profile.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set.

Evaluation:

The model achieves an accuracy of 93.75% on the training data and 96.25% on the testing data.
This suggests that the model can effectively predict admission chances based on the available data.

Predictive System:

The project includes a script to make predictions for new applicants.
Users can input an applicant's profile information, and the script will predict their admission chances.

Disclaimer:

This is a sample project and may not be representative of real-world graduate admission systems.
Actual admission decisions are complex and consider various factors beyond the scope of this project.

Further Work:

Explore other machine learning algorithms and compare their performance.
Incorporate additional features, such as work experience or specific program requirements.
Develop a user-friendly interface for the predictive system.

Technologies:

Programming language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, sklearn
