Mall Customer Segmentation

Description:

This project analyzes historical customer data from a mall to identify distinct customer segments based on their demographics and spending habits. By understanding these segments, the mall management can:

Develop targeted marketing campaigns: Tailor promotions, offers, and loyalty programs to resonate with specific customer groups, maximizing marketing effectiveness and return on investment.
Optimize store layout and product offerings: Cater to the preferences and behaviors of different segments by strategically placing stores and products within the mall.
Enhance customer experience: Create personalized experiences and services specific to each segment's needs, fostering loyalty and satisfaction.

Data:

The project utilizes the "Mall_Customers.csv" dataset, which includes the following attributes:

CustomerID (unique identifier)
Gender (male or female)
Age (numerical value)
Annual Income (k$) (numerical value)
Spending Score (1-100) (numerical value)

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing:

Import libraries: Necessary libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn are imported.
Load data: The "Mall_Customers.csv" dataset is loaded using pandas.
Handle missing values: Check for missing values and handle them appropriately (e.g., impute with mean, median, or drop rows).
Explore and summarize data: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of variables, identify outliers, and uncover any relationships between features.
Visualize data: Create informative visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to gain insights into the data.

Feature Engineering:

Consider additional features: If relevant, create new features that might be informative for segmentation (e.g., product categories purchased, frequency of visits).
Encoding categorical features: Encode categorical features (e.g., gender) using one-hot encoding or other suitable methods.

Data Standardization:

Standardize numerical features: Standardize numerical features (e.g., age, annual income, spending score) to ensure they have equal weight during clustering.

Clustering:

Choose clustering algorithm: Select an appropriate clustering algorithm based on the data characteristics and project goals. Common choices include K-Means, hierarchical clustering, or density-based clustering.
Determine number of clusters: Apply elbow method or other techniques to find the optimal number of clusters that capture meaningful segments.
Perform clustering: Run the chosen clustering algorithm on the standardized data to assign customers to clusters.

Analysis and Interpretation:

Cluster characteristics: Analyze each cluster to understand its demographics, spending habits, and other key characteristics.
Visualize clusters: Create visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, boxplots) to compare and contrast clusters.
Insights: Draw insights from the clustering results, identifying distinct customer segments and their unique characteristics.

Application and Recommendations:

Target marketing: Based on the insights, suggest tailored marketing campaigns for each segment.
Store layout and product offerings: Recommend strategies to optimize the mall layout and product offerings to cater to different segments.
Customer experience: Propose ways to enhance the customer experience for each segment, building loyalty and satisfaction.
